You acknowledge and agree that the Agreements supersede any previous agreements with Sprout or the Custodian.

11.3 Dispute Resolution

This Program Agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause, which applies to this Program Agreement, the Advisory Agreement (Attachment A), and the Brokerage Agreement (Attachment B). By signing this Program Agreement, Sprout, the Custodian, and you agree as follows:

All parties to this Program Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.

Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a partyâs ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.

The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.

The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.

The panel of arbitrators may include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.

The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.

The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Program Agreement.

Pre-Dispute Arbitration Clause : All controversies that may arise between you and Sprout or between you and the Custodian concerning any subject matter, issue, or circumstance whatsoever (including controversies concerning any account, order, or transaction, or the continuation, performance, interpretation, or breach of this, the other Agreements, or any other agreement between you and Sprout or the Custodian, whether entered into or arising before, on, or after the date this account is opened) shall be determined by binding arbitration through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (âFINRAâ). You acknowledge that judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Program Agreement except to the extent stated herein.

11.4 Severability

If any provision of any of the Agreements is held unenforceable or invalid under any law, rule, or administrative or judicial order or decision, that holding shall not alter the enforceability or validity of the Agreementsâ remaining provisions.

General Information

Sprout Advisers LLC (Sprout) offers the Sprout Advisers Wrap Fee Program (the Program) to prospective clients. We are registered with the SEC as an Investment Adviser. Our principal office is at 19900 MacArthur Blvd, #500, Irvine, CA 92612. For questions, please call Sprout at (949) 438-4253 or email at info@Sproutadvisers.com.

Program Description

Sprout offers an easy way to regularly invest small and large amounts of money. Sprout offers a computer software-based algorithm that provides clients investment advice on allocations of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on personalized information that each client enters through the website or application. We place orders with our affiliated broker, Sprout Securities, LLC (Sprout Securities), to buy, rebalance, and sell the allocation each client selects. By combining brokerage and advisory services into the Program, Sprout simplifies the investment process for its customers. Sprout will interact with clients using a software application developed by its parent company, Sprout Grow, Inc.

The Program was designed for early adoption of non-retirement savings and does not incorporate overall financial or tax planning.

Portfolio Management

Sprout manages client portfolios in the Program with strategies based on Modern Portfolio Theory. Dr. Harry Markowitz, the Nobel Prize winning economist and founder of Modern Portfolio Theory, serves on the Sprout Investment Committee. Sprout constructs, revises, and recommends model portfolios with target allocations of equity and fixed-income ETFs. Then, initial allocations are determined by the software-based algorithm, which selects among the target allocations based on information from clients about their financial situation and risk profile.

When a client deposits money, Sprout constructs a combination of ETF purchases to align his or her account along the corresponding target allocation. Upon a clientâs request to withdraw money, a combination of ETF sales are initiated while continuing to pursue the 4 corresponding target allocation.

Clients may manually select one of the target allocations other than the one recommended or currently in effect. As clients deposit or withdraw money the corresponding transactions will rebalance to pursue the modified target allocation. If the holdings of the account significantly deviate from the newly selected target allocation, then Sprout will initiate a rebalancing to bring the holdings within an acceptable range of the target allocation.

The Sprout algorithm is designed to keep the holdings within each clientâs portfolio within a specified range of the target allocation, even when the market prices of the ETFs fluctuate.

Sproutâ clients agree to rebalance holdings automatically and to re-invest dividends automatically.

Sprout provides investment advisory services only through the Program. Clients should consider which, if any, of the portfolios offered through the Program results in the best allocation for their specific circumstances.

Fees

Sproutâ clients pay an annual wrap fee of .25% for account balance of $5000 or more. Accounts under $5000 are subject to a fixed fee of $1 per month for personal use of the Sproutâ web or mobile application. The fees are not negotiable. The wrap fee includes advisory services, execution, clearance, custody, and account reporting. The fee schedule is as follows:

Account Balance

Fee

Under $5,000

Lesser of month-end account balance or $1 per month.

$5,000 or more

.25% /year, charged monthly

Clients should be aware that Sprout is designed with frequent investing in mind. The fee structure may not be appropriate for individuals looking to make few or infrequent small-dollar investments.

The wrap fee is calculated based on the clientâs average daily balance and charged monthly in arrears. Custodian will deduct fees from the assets in the clientâs account on a monthly basis to pay Sprout.

Transaction costs are absorbed by Sprout as part of the Program. Clients may find the advisory and other services that comprise the Program may exceed the costs of similar services purchased separately

The ETFs recommended by Sprout have fees that are separate and distinct from the fees paid to Sprout for its wrap fee program. These fees are outlined in the prospectus for each ETF.

Sprout reserves the right to waive any fees associated with the Program at its sole discretion.

Brokerage and Custody Services

Sprout will use its affiliated broker-dealer, Sprout Securities, as custodian for its clientsâ accounts. Clients agree to direct brokerage in their accounts with Sprout Securities. Sprout Securities will be responsible for confirmations and statements. It will utilize RBC Capital Markets, LLC as a custodian to hold clientsâ funds and ETF shares in safekeeping and to execute, clear, and settle ETF trades on an omnibus basis.

Account Requirements and Types of Clients

The Program is available to individuals who are legal U.S. residents and maintain a checking account with a U.S. bank. There is no minimum account size, and the minimum deposit is $5.

Portfolio Manager Selection and Evaluation

Sprout directly manages client portfolios in the Program.

Client Information Provided to Portfolio Managers

Sprout manages all client portfolios directly using its interactive software application and algorithm and does not use external or individual portfolio managers.

At account opening, clients must provide, and the algorithm for selecting among target allocations considers each clientâs: age; financial condition; employment status; investment objectives; time horizon; and risk tolerance. Sprout will require clients who accumulate investments exceeding specified amounts to provide additional information regarding their financial circumstances from time to time.

Client Contact with Portfolio Managers

Clients are encouraged contact Sprout via email. Access to investment advisory personnel is limited to normal business hours. However, Sprout provides investment advice only through its online interactive software application.

A1. Investment Advice

A1.1 Portfolios

Sprout will develop the Portfolios and enhance or update the Portfolios from time to time. You agree that Sprout may modify from time to time the number of Portfolios that it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to address the investment objectives, time horizons, and risk tolerances associated with categories of clients. You agree that Sprout may, in its sole discretion, modify from time to time the selection of the ETFs that comprise each of the Portfolios and the relative weightings of the ETFs within each of the Portfolios. Nothing in this Section A1.1 shall be deemed as limiting your rights or Sproutâ obligations under federal or state securities laws and regulations.

Sprout will use the Application to provide you with information about the composition and investment objectives of the Portfolios. You agree that:

the Portfolios are subject to the investment risks described in Section 7 of the Program Agreement;

any projected returns associated with any Portfolio may not materialize; and

any hypothetical back tested returns associated with any Portfolio are based on assumptions and do not reflect actual results of any Sprout Account.

A1.2 Suggested Portfolio

Sprout will use a proprietary algorithm that is part of the Portfolio Advisory Application to recommend to you a Suggested Portfolio among the Portfolios. You acknowledge that Sprout identifies the Suggested Portfolio in reliance on the Client Information you provide. You agree to provide Sprout with Client Information about you and that you are responsible for ensuring Client Information is true, accurate, complete, and current in accordance with applicable law and Section 4 of the Program Agreement, including the representations, warranties, agreements and indemnification provisions of Section 4 of the Program Agreement. Sprout shall not be liable for any identification of a Suggested Portfolio based on untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date Client Information. You agree that you will access and review information identifying and describing the Suggested Portfolio using the Portfolio Advice Application.

You acknowledge that, based on the Client Information you provide and the Investment Advisory methodology used in developing the Portfolio Advice Application, the Suggested Portfolio is the choice among the Portfolios that Sprout recommends as best for you. However, you agree that there is no guarantee, representation, warranty, or covenant that the Suggested Portfolio will perform better over any time period than any other Portfolio or any other investment. You agree that:

the Suggested Portfolio is subject to the investment risks described in Section 7 of the Program Agreement;

any projected returns associated with your Suggested Portfolio may not materialize; and

any hypothetical back tested returns associated with your Suggested Portfolio are based on assumptions and do not reflect actual results of any Sprout Account.

A1.3 Selected Portfolio

You may choose any one of the Portfolios to be your Selected Portfolio. You are not obligated to choose the Suggested Portfolio to be your Selected Portfolio. You may change your Selected Portfolio at any time. There may not be more than one Selected Portfolio for your Sprout Account. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the choice among the Portfolios of your choice Selected Portfolio. Sprout shall not have authority or discretion to select any of the Portfolios, including the Suggested Portfolio, for you. You further acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review and carefully consider the information the information available on the Sprout Website about each of the Portfolios and their constituent ETFs before choosing your Selected Portfolio.

While the Program is designed so that trading in your Sprout Account over time causes the holdings to replicate your Selected Portfolio, you agree that there is no guarantee, representation, warranty, or covenant that the holdings in your Sprout Account will match the allocations of your Selected Portfolio. You acknowledge that various factors (including the timing and frequency of Deposits and Withdrawals, market volatility and disruptions, the timing and frequency of your choice of or changes to your Selected Portfolio, any exclusion of an ETF from your Selected Portfolio, access interruptions, and hardware or software failures) can impact the extent to which holdings in your Sprout Account will replicate your Selected Portfolio at any particular point in time.

If you choose a Selected Portfolio other than the Suggested Portfolio, you acknowledge and agree, without limiting any other provision of the Program Agreement or this Advisory Agreement, that:

you will assume the risk that your Selected Portfolio may perform worse for you over any time period than the Suggested Portfolio or any other investment;

your Selected Portfolio may not be suitable with respect to your investment objectives, risk tolerance, age, financial condition, or other facts or circumstances that apply to you; and

Sprout shall not be liable for any losses or other damages resulting from your choice of a Selected Portfolio.

You acknowledge and agree that:

The Program is designed for investments in ETFs allocated so that the resulting holdings tend to replicate one of the Portfolios over time.

Sprout designed the selection and relative weighting of the ETFs in each of the Portfolios to pursue specific investment objectives, including diversification.

Removing any ETF from any of the Portfolios will change the weightings of ETFs in the resulting altered portfolio in a way that deviates from Sproutâ investment advice and may adversely impact performance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may exclude from your Selected Portfolio any one of the ETFs that otherwise comprise your Selected Portfolio if, after carefully reviewing and analyzing all pertinent information available on the Sprout Website or through the Application about your Selected Portfolio, you conclude that you do not want to own any one of the ETFs in the Selected Portfolio. You may request to exclude from or re-include in your Selected Portfolio an ETF at any time by emailing info@Sproutadvisers.com. You acknowledge and agree that, due to the relatively small number of ETFs in each of the Portfolios, it would not be reasonable for you to request the exclusion of more than one ETF from any Portfolio. You therefore agree that you shall not have the ability to exclude more than one ETF from your Selected Portfolio at any time. If you exclude an ETF from your Selected Portfolio, the remaining ETFs in your Selected Portfolio will be allocated relative to each other in the same proportions that they are allocated relative to each other in the Portfolio on which your selected Portfolio is based. You acknowledge that excluding an ETF from your Selected Portfolio may adversely impact its performance. By excluding an ETF, you acknowledge and agree, without limiting any other provision of the Program Agreement or this Advisory Agreement, that:

you will assume the risk that your Selected Portfolio may perform worse for you over any time period than the Suggested Portfolio, any of the other Portfolios on which your Selected Portfolio is based, or any other investment;

your Selected Portfolio may not be suitable with respect to your investment objectives, risk tolerance, age, financial condition, or other facts or circumstances that apply to you; and

Sprout shall not be liable for any losses or other damages resulting from your exclusion of any ETF from your Selected Portfolio.

A1.4 Ongoing Advice to Help Your Holdings Track Selected Portfolio

You authorize Sprout to conduct Rebalancings from time to time in your Sprout Account. A proprietary algorithm in the Application will calculate the Purchases and Sales for each Rebalancing based on automated analysis of your Sprout Account holdings relative to your Selected Portfolio. Sprout will design the Orders for Rebalancing to cause the holdings in your Sprout Account to replicate your Selected Portfolio more closely after settlement of the Purchases and Sales that comprise the Rebalancing than before settlement of such Purchases and Sales. You agree that Sprout may modify at any time the manner in which, or the frequency with which, Sprout calculates, generates, and places with the Custodian the Orders for Rebalancing. You acknowledge that changes, particularly volatile changes, in the market price of the ETFs in your Selected Portfolio relative to each other may prevent Rebalancings from successfully making your Sprout Account holdings more closely approximate your Selected Portfolio.

You authorize Sprout to conduct Reinvestments on your behalf after each receipt in your Sprout Account of a dividend on ETF Shares you own through the Program. Sprout will generally design the Orders for Reinvestments to approximate your Selected Portfolio. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Agreements or elsewhere, you agree that Sprout shall be under no duty to conduct, and makes no guarantee that it will conduct, any Rebalancing or Reinvestment at any particular time or a Purchase or Sale for Rebalancing of any ETF Shares in any particular amount.

A1.5 Standard of Care

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Program Agreement and this Advisory Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 10 of the Program Agreement) and without limiting any rights you may have under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and other applicable United States federal or state securities law, Sprout shall exercise the level of care in providing the Advisory Services that is customary and reasonable in the industry for investment advisers providing investment advice solely through internet-accessed computer applications.

A1.6 Scope and Delivery of Our Investment Advice

You acknowledge and agree that Sprout will not provide investment advice other than the investment advice described in this Section A1 and will not provide you Advisory Services separate from the Program. You agree that Sprout will provide you investment advice and deliver the Advisory Services solely electronically in accordance with Section 6 of the Program Agreement. You acknowledge that Sprout will not provide you investment advice in person, over the phone, or in other than information available on the Application and Sprout Website and communications through the Portfolio Advice Application. You acknowledge that you will not be entitled or able to transact in or hold securities in your Sprout Account other than the ETF Shares selected by Sprout to comprise the Portfolios for the Program.

Sprout will undertake good faith efforts and generally expects to generate and place the Orders for such Purchases on the Business Day after the Custodian credits each applicable Deposit at Will to your Sprout Account, but you acknowledge and agree that such Orders may be placed any time within five Business Days after the day the Custodian credits the applicable Deposit at Will to your Sprout Account.

You further agree that, by using your Spending Account in a way that causes the sum of Pending Round Ups to equal or exceed $5, you authorize Sprout to place Orders with the Custodian on your behalf for Purchases of the ETFs that comprise your Selected Portfolio in amounts calculated by the Portfolio Advice Application such that the resulting holdings in your Sprout Account after settlement of such Purchases will approximate your Selected Portfolio. Sprout will undertake good faith efforts and generally expects to generate and place the Orders for such Purchases on the Business Day after the Custodian credits each applicable Round Up Deposit to your Sprout Account, but you acknowledge and agree that such Orders may be placed any time within five Business Days after the day the Custodian credits the applicable Round Up Deposit to your Sprout Account.

A2.1.3 Debit Card Deposits

You agree that, before you connect your Funding Account to your Sprout Account using the Application, you may make up to $100 in Debit Card Deposits.

You agree that you will not be entitled to make more than $100 in Debit Card Deposits to your Sprout Account and that you will not, regardless of the amount of Debit Card Deposits you have made, be able to make any Debit Card Deposits to your Sprout Account once you have connected your Funding Account to your Sprout Account using the Application in accordance with Section A2.4 below of this Advisory Agreement. You agree that Sprout will instruct the Custodian to reject any request by you of a Debit Card Deposit that would, if processed, cause the total of Debit Card Deposits to your Sprout Account to exceed $100.

You may, subject to Sections 8 and 10 of the Program Agreement, withdraw money from your investments in the Program by initiating a Withdrawal request through the Application at any time.

You agree that, by requesting a Withdrawal, you authorize Sprout to place an order with the Custodian on your behalf for Sales of ETF Shares in your Sprout Account in amounts calculated by the Portfolio Advice Application such that the resulting holdings in your Sprout Account after settlement of such Sales will approximate your Selected Portfolio.

Sprout will send any Withdrawal request you initiate through the Application to the ACH Operator. You agree that, by requesting a Withdrawal, you authorize the ACH Operator to request that the Custodian transfer the proceeds of the applicable Sales in the amount you request (or less if the money remaining in your Sprout Account after deducted any Wrap Fee or other fee due is less) to your Funding Account.

You shall be required to connect your Sprout Account to your Funding Account by entering into the Application true, accurate, current, and complete information about your Funding Account, including the American Bankers Association routing number and account number for your Funding Account. You acknowledge that the information you enter into the Application about your Funding Account is Client Information subject to the representations, warranties, and indemnification provisions of Section 4 of the Program Agreement.

You further agree that, if your Funding Account is closed or restricted after you connect it to your Sprout Account, you will have no right under the Agreements to make Deposits or Withdrawals unless and until: (i) your Funding Account is reopened or unrestricted; or (ii) you successfully connect a different Funding Account to your Sprout Account.
